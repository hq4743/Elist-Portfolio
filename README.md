The analysis uncovers actionable insights into Elist’s revenue drivers, customer purchasing patterns, and geographic performance, identifying areas of over- and under-performance across the business. These findings inform decisions across operations, marketing, and sales. These insights were derived from Elist’s core datasets spanning orders, customers, products, and geographic information.

***Average Order Value : The AOV view shows clear variation across product categories, with premium products consistently driving higher order values compared to lower-priced items. Repeat customers also tend to place higher-value orders than first-time buyers, indicating a positive relationship between customer tenure and spend.

**Overall Sales Trends**: What we see (trend & comparison):
Sales trends indicate overall growth with noticeable fluctuations over time, suggesting seasonality and campaign-driven spikes. Revenue is not evenly distributed across products, with a small subset of SKUs accounting for a large share of total sales.

**Loyalty Members** :**Customers engaged through loyalty or marketing channels demonstrate stronger purchasing behavior compared to non-engaged customers, including higher order frequency and more consistent repeat purchases.

**Apple Product Performance** : Apple products consistently outperform other brands in revenue contribution despite representing a smaller share of total orders. In contrast, non-premium brands generate higher order counts but lower revenue per order.

Together, these insights highlight opportunities to grow revenue through a combination of premium product focus, customer retention strategies, and diversified product performance, rather than relying solely on volume-driven growth.
